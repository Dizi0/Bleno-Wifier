# RpiBlenoWifiConnector
A bluetooth program to connect your Rpi to your wi-fi when you don't have access to basic inputs (SSH, keyboard and mouse)


## Installation

Tested with Node.Js v15.0

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
Bleno requires Sudo permissions to run correctly


```bash
sudo node index.js
```

## More about this 
I created this project because I had to connect several new RPI each weeks, and having to plug a screen and keyboard became quite a tedious task

This projets comes with an Ionic app that scans for Bluetooth devices having a name, and let you send your network password using this script.
